Deep Think
Through exploring the frontiers of Geminiâ€™s thinking capabilities, weâ€™re starting to test an enhanced reasoning mode called Deep Think that uses new research techniques enabling the model to consider multiple hypotheses before responding.

2.5 Pro Deep Think gets an impressive score on 2025 USAMO, currently one of the hardest math benchmarks. It also leads on LiveCodeBench, a difficult benchmark for competition-level coding, and scores 84.0% on MMMU, which tests multimodal reasoning.

Minochi across control (computer science) and experimental Gemini instructions (cancer computational biology) on Colab, on A100 40GB coming up.

Hypothesis, for all LLMs that will ever be trained on Colab, None will be equal to or greater than Minochi
